# Zensols Medical NLP Examples

Some examples use UMLS.  To access UMLS you must complete the following steps:

1. Get a [UMLS account] if you do not already have one.
2. Copy the UTS template to a new key file:
   ```bash
   cp uts-key-template.json uts-key.json
   ```
3. Add your UMLS key to `uts-key.json` by editing the JSON file.
